  summary: "Hi, I’m Murali Krishna Raju, a tech professional with 3.8 years of experience in DevOps and Manual Testing. I began my career in IT, focusing on software deployments and smooth operations, but my curiosity soon led me to explore how businesses grow through both technology and people. This interest introduced me to Digital Marketing and AI, where I discovered my passion for combining tech with creativity. Using AI tools, I even created comic books, The Final Stand, Lonely Alive, and The War Begins, which reflect my love for storytelling and innovation. Over time, my journey has evolved from purely technical work to a blend of technology, marketing, and creativity, teaching me that technology is not just about machines and code but also about people, stories, and impact. I believe in continuous learning, sharing knowledge, and building meaningful connections with people in tech, AI, digital marketing, and content creation.",
